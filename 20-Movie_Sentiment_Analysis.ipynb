Those frequently occurring words typically don't contain useful or discriminatory information. In this subsection, we will learn about a useful technique called term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) that can be used to downweight those frequently occurring words in the feature vectors. The tf-idf can be de ned as the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency:\n",
