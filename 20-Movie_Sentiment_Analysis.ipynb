    "When we are analyzing text data, we often encounter words that occur across multiple documents from both classes. Those frequently occurring words typically don't contain useful or discriminatory information. In this subsection, we will learn about a useful technique called term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) that can be used to downweight those frequently occurring words in the feature vectors. The tf-idf can be de considered as the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{tf-idf}(t,d)=\\text{tf (t,d)}\\times \\text{idf}(t,d)$$\n",
    "Here the tf(t, d) is the term frequency that we introduced in the previous section, and the inverse document frequency idf(t, d) can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{idf}(t,d) = \\text{log}\\frac{n_d}{1+\\text{df}(d, t)},$$\n",
    "where $n_d$ is the total number of documents, and df(d, t) is the number of documents d that contain the term t. Note that adding the constant 1 to the denominator is optional and serves the purpose of assigning a non-zero value to terms that occur in all training samples; the log is used to ensure that low document frequencies are not given too much weight.\n",

    "However, if we'd manually calculated the tf-idfs of the individual terms in our feature vectors, we'd have noticed that the TfidfTransformer calculates the tf-idfs slightly differently compared to the standard textbook equations that we saw earlier.

However, some Windows users reported issues when running the previous code with the `n_jobs=-1` setting related to pickling the tokenizer and tokenizer_porter functions for multiprocessing on Windows. Another workaround would be to replace those two functions, `[tokenizer, tokenizer_porter]`, with `[str.split]`. However, note that the replacement by the simple str.split would not support stemming.\n",
